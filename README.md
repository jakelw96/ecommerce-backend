## Installation

Doing a download of the code from GitHub to start. You then will need to install all dependencies listed on the package json file. You then may start the server with "npm start". You will then need to use an application that can test the server endpoints.

## Usage

Once ran, using an application to test server endpoints, you can add, update data using json format. You may also view the data at the right endpoint and delete with the correct id. SIDE NOTE- after the database is created, you will need to change the "sync" on server.js to force false, as this will not allow the seed data to seed properly.
